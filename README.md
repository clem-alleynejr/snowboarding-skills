# Checkers

(Not Chess)

Two players - each on opposite ends of the board. Each player starts with 12 pieces (checkers) each.

Checkers can only move diagonally on gold squares. Checkers can "jump" over opponent checkers diagonally. At 
which point, that "jumped" opponent checker will be considered captured and removed from the board.

The goal is the capture all the checkers of the opponent!
